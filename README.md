Crowd Photo
=============

Who?
---
Developer: Buddy Lindsey, Jr.
Designer: Shane Cowherd

What?
-----
Sometimes, us, bloggers need images and we have no way of getting them legally, usually due to copyright and distance. So, Crowd Photo to the rescue. Bloggers, or anyone, can request a pictures of something/somewhere, and nice Photographers can go take a picture of it for them.

When?
-----
This was developed during DjangoDash 2012 as part of a 48 hour competition. We had a lot of fun.

Where?
-----
Hopefully anyone anywhere can take pictures for others anywhere. 

Why?
----
The Idea started from a blogger friend who blogs about Japan, but since he didn't live there he offere bounties on his site if people would take specific pictures for him. This site just takes it to the next level.

How (It Works)?
----

There are 2 people that the site is geared for, `Bloggers` and `Photographers`.

Bloggers
Login and you can request a photo by puching in specific information and adding a pin to a map. Later after photographers have uploaded pictures you can go through and approve them.

Photographers
You can view all the photographs that people are requesting, and once you take the picture you can login and offer it to the blogger.
